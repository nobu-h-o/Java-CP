# Maps: HashMaps and TreeMaps
The Map is known as a data structure that sorts information in key, value pairs. You can think of it as an array, where you can choose what index to use, including the
index's data type.

## HashMaps and TreeMaps
Java has 2 maps provided in the standard library. The HashMap and the TreeMap. The key difference here is that the TreeMap is ordered while the HashMap is not.

# Introduction and Prerequisites
The document(s) provided here aim to prep students who have taken courses in Java and are interested in Competitive Programming (CP)
into completing the "easy" questions. The easy questions refer to questions A and B on [AtCoder's Beginner Contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/archive?ratedType=1&category=0&keyword=).

## Prerequisites
You should be able to write a basic "Hello World" program in Java and also use data types such as ints, chars and also arrays. OOP basics would help a lot in the "Extra"
sections, but I don't think it's necessary.
